1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
We start by building SecretHawk.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,900
Now we intentionally recreate a secret leak.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,800
Scan runs and flags one critical secret.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,300
Next we export JSON findings for automation.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,300
Dry-run remediation shows the fix plan safely.

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,600
Finally, we generate an incident report for the trail.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:11,960
Done: detect, remediate, and report end to end.
